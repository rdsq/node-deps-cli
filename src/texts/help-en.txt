Show Node.js package's dependencies in a fancy way

Usage: node-deps

Simply run this command inside a Node package, and you will see its dependencies

You can also add path like this:

node-deps ./path/to/package

And see that directory's dependencies
It looks up the current directory by default
You can also include the package.json file in path if you want

Alternatively you can do:

node-deps -

For it to read the package.json contents from stdin
This way you can combine it with software like curl

curl -s -L https://github.com/npm/cli/raw/refs/heads/latest/package.json | node-deps -
